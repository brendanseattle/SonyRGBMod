## Overview

This mod uses the OSD mux circuit to combine the analog RGB signal produced by the television's On Screen Display (menus, etc) with the external RGB signal from your retro video game consoles. This method is newer than the legacy, outdated methods of snipping the existing circuits and injecting the console signals. The benefit of this method are 1) you can have the menu display on top of your RGB video, 2) no permanent damage is done to the TV and 3) it's easier. 

See following diagram for an overview of what this circuit looks like. (Note these chip names and pins are specific to the Sanyo set. Can be ignored for the purposes of this guide)

The BA-4D Sony sets have been successfully modified using the mux method for SCART input as well as BNC. If you choose to use BNC connectors, I recommend purchasing a BNC to S-Video adapter (if your set is one of the larger models, such as KV-27x) or a BNC to RCA adapter for the sync line. This is because it is much easier to use an existing video input on the TV for your RGB's sync signal than installing a 4th BNC line injected to the Y/C Jungle.
